# Google Map API

#### A Google map app that searches the location by latitude and longitude, 05/25/17

## description

A website to show locations via google maps api. A feature is included to bring the map back to the user's current location, and we have included earthquake data from the USGS using an earthquake_GeoJSONP datafile, using the magnitude of an earthquake at that particular location to create proportionally sized red circles.
